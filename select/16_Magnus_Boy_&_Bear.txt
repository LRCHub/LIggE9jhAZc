There's hope that can keep you sane
And I'm holding the answers tight
But there's nothing to ascertain
Where I go from here, but I found
A soul that can acclimate
To something else entirely new
Is worth its weight in every way

It's a fine line
It's a lone view
There are those amongst us who are not afraid if they lose
Pick your moment
To become something more
I didn't mean to worry you but
And it's a fact this fever's on the rise
Hmm, come to me, yeah
Pick the right line
And swallow it whole

And open up your eyes
Or take solace in the mystic's lies
Oh, I never saw much point in each arrangement
If you can't find some peace of mind and peace of mind, so
A piece of your mind, let's go

And it's a fine line
And it's a full moon
But it's a trap to find yourself with all the answers
Pick your moment
And become something more
I didn't mean to worry you but
And it's a fact this rapid's on the rise
Hmm, follow me, yeah
Pick the right line
And swallow it whole

And it's a fine line
It's a full moon
There are those amongst us who are not afraid if they lose
Pick your moment
To become something more
I didn't mean to worry you but
And it's a fact this fever's on the rise
Hmm, follow me, yeah
Pick the right line
And swallow it whole

Pick the right line
And swallow it whole
